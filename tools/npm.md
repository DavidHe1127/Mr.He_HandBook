## NPM Notes

* [Scripts](#scripts)

#scripts 
Using `npm scripts` has a few benefits over the other JS automation tools such as ```grunt and gulp```.
* `npm` will automatically setup `$PATH` to look into `node_modules/.bin`, so you can just run commands supplied by `dependencies` and `devDependencies` directly without a global installation of module.
* No need to install `grunt-cli` globally anymore
To incorporate a module into your project, that module needs a `CLI` so you can run from npm scripts.
