##CSS Essentials

* Position and Layout
  * [Relative Absolute Position](#absolute-relative-position)

#absolute-relative-position
`absolute`
* Out of document flow
* Element space is not preserved (as opposed to relative)
* Position relatively to element's direct ancestor element (might be <body> and not static position)

`relative`
* In the document flow
* Elements added before it affects its position since `relative` makes element in document flow - see `css.html`

See `css.html` for more examples.
