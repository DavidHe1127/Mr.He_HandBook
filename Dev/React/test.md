### Test ref

```js
it('calls onChange with the new value when the value has changed', () => {
  const ref = React.createRef();
  const wrapper = mount(
    <div>
      <Input ref={ref} />
    </div>
  );

  expect(ReactTestUtils.isDOMComponent(ref.current)).toBeTruthy();
  expect(ref.current.tagName).toEqual('INPUT');
});
```

Oftentimes, you use 3rd UI libraries and still want to pass `ref` to them. It's fine but where `ref` is bound to is controlled by libraries themselves. For example, `react-day-picker` takes `ref` and attaches it to the class instance called `DayPicker`.

To ensure you pass `ref` to it, you can do:

```js
import ReactDayPicker from 'react-day-picker';

it('pass ref to access dom node', () => {
  const ref = React.createRef();
  mount(
    <div>
      <DatePicker ref={ref} />
    </div>
  );
  const res = ReactTestUtils.isCompositeComponentWithType(
    ref.current,
    ReactDayPicker
  );
  expect(res).toBe(true);
});
```

### Dont test implementation details

Implementation details refer to the details around how you achieve the desired component behaviours.

Consider code below:
```js
import React from 'react'
import AccordionContents from './accordion-contents'
class Accordion extends React.Component {
  state = {openIndex: 0}
  setOpenIndex = openIndex => this.setState({openIndex})
  render() {
    const {openIndex} = this.state
    return (
      <div>
        {this.props.items.map((item, index) => (
          <>
            <button onClick={() => this.setOpenIndex(index)}>
              {item.title}
            </button>
            {index === openIndex ? (
              <AccordionContents>{item.contents}</AccordionContents>
            ) : null}
          </>
        ))}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
export default Accordion

// test
import React from 'react'
// if you're wondering why not shallow,
// then please read https://kcd.im/shallow
import Enzyme, {mount} from 'enzyme'
import EnzymeAdapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16'
import Accordion from '../accordion'
// Setup enzyme's react adapter
Enzyme.configure({adapter: new EnzymeAdapter()})
test('setOpenIndex sets the open index state properly', () => {
  const wrapper = mount(<Accordion items={[]} />)
  expect(wrapper.state('openIndex')).toBe(0)
  wrapper.instance().setOpenIndex(1)
  expect(wrapper.state('openIndex')).toBe(1)
})
```

As you can see, it's testing state but as an end user, we don't care about `openIndex` is kept as an internal state we only care about when a segement of accordion is opened/closed when being clicked.

So we should test behaviour:
```js
import React from 'react'
import {render, fireEvent} from 'react-testing-library'
import Accordion from '../accordion'
test('can open accordion items to see the contents', () => {
  const hats = {title: 'Favorite Hats', contents: 'Fedoras are classy'}
  const footware = {
    title: 'Favorite Footware',
    contents: 'Flipflops are the best',
  }
  const {getByText, queryByText} = render(
    <Accordion items={[hats, footware]} />,
  )
  expect(getByText(hats.contents)).toBeInTheDocument()
  expect(queryByText(footware.contents)).toBeNull()
  fireEvent.click(getByText(footware.title))
  expect(getByText(footware.contents)).toBeInTheDocument()
  expect(queryByText(hats.contents)).toBeNull()
})
```
