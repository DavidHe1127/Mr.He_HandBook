#Best Practice

* Use `let` and `const` in place of `var` since they are both block-scoped variables.

* Defind multiple variables
```javascript
//bad
var a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;

//ok not the best
var a = 1;
var b = 2;
var c = 3;

//best
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
const c = 3;
```

* Type casting
```javascript
var reviewScore = 9;

// bad
const totalScore = this.reviewScore + ''; // invokes this.reviewScore.valueOf()
// bad
const totalScore = this.reviewScore.toString(); // isn't guaranteed to return a string
// good
const totalScore = String(this.reviewScore);

const age = 0;
// bad
const hasAge = new Boolean(age);
// good
const hasAge = Boolean(age);
// best
const hasAge = !!age;
```

* When enumerating an object you need to filter the prototype methods 
```javascript
typeof object[key] !== 'function' // or object.hasOwnProperty(key)
```

* Cache the length of an array
``` for(var i = 0, max = Array.length; i < max; i++) {//Do something} ```

* Always ends switch with a default to ensure there is always a sane result

* Use !==  and  ===

* Use `Number("08")`  rather than parseInt when doing int conversion

* Use `var o = {} and var a = []` literal way rather than new Object and new Array()

* '' means null while ' ' means one whitespace

* Context is always the value of the `this` keyword, which is a reference to the object that **owns** the currently executing code

* Each "+" operation will trigger memory allocation. Use
`var a = [1,2].join('');`
