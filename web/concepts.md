* [WebAssembly](#web-assembly)


### premature_optimization
Any coding practice that makes your code harder to understand in the name of performance is a `premature optimization`.


### web-assembly
* It's a new kind of code that can be compiled (ahead of time) down into a binary format that browsers can read. This means that high-level languages (C, C++) can be compiled down into a format that is legible to the browser. For developers that want to do some heavy computing on the web, this is a huge plus.
* At the time of writing, it does not support `DOM access` - so JS is still needed.
