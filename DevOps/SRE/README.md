### SLI vs SLA vs SLO

> Assuming that your Service Level Indicators (SLIs) are - `xyz is true`, then the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) which are organization-level objectives will read - `xyz is true for a % of time` and the corresponding Service Level Agreements (SLAs) meant for external/ end users are legal contracts that say - `Promise xyz is true for a % of time, if not then, so and so will be compensated`.
