### AWS Inspector vs GuardDuty

- Inspector is a service that automatically performs vulnerability diagnosis on AWS EC2 instances. Vulnerability diagnosis is a system to determine the security level of a specific website or public server by sending packets of methods commonly used in cyber-attacks.
- GuardDuty analyzes the actual logs to see if a threat exists.
