* You are charged for `EBS` storage for the amount of storage provisioned to your account, measured in "gigabyte-months."
  `EC2` instances accrue charges only while they're running, but `EBS` volumes attached to instances continue to retain information and 
  accrue charges, even when the instance is stopped. To stop EBS-related charges, delete EBS volumes and EBS snapshots you don't need.
