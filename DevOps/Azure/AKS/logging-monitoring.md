# Logging & Monitoring

## Logging

- `Container Insights` collect container logs and send them to log analytics workspace. It can also collect metrics but it's a best practice to disable it for cost savings and rather use other tools for metric collection e.g prometheus.

## Monitoring

- Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus

## Visualization

- Grafana?
